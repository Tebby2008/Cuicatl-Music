# Rethinking Mathematics: A Case for Its Classification as a Humanities Discipline

## Abstract
Mathematics has long been situated within the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) framework, primarily due to its applications in scientific and technological contexts. However, this classification overlooks the philosophical, cultural, and humanistic dimensions of mathematics. This essay argues that mathematics should be reclassified as a humanities discipline, emphasizing its historical roots, aesthetic qualities, and role in shaping human thought. Drawing on scholarly sources, it also addresses counterarguments that defend mathematics’ place in STEM, ultimately advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the discipline.

## Introduction
The acronym STEM has become synonymous with progress, innovation, and economic competitiveness. Mathematics, as the “M” in STEM, is often portrayed as a purely objective, utilitarian tool for scientific and technological advancement. Yet, this perspective neglects the fact that mathematics is also a deeply human endeavor—rooted in philosophy, aesthetics, and cultural expression. As Cassius Keyser once argued, “Nothing is better entitled to rank as one of the great Humanities than Mathematics itself” (Abrams, 2021). This essay contends that mathematics should be considered a humanities discipline, not merely a STEM subject, because of its historical development, philosophical nature, and cultural significance.

## Historical and Philosophical Foundations

### Mathematics as a Humanistic Pursuit
The origins of mathematics are intertwined with philosophy and the arts. In ancient Greece, the Pythagoreans approached mathematics as a means of uncovering universal truths, not merely as a tool for engineering or commerce. Helmut Hasse observed that “mathematics of the classical Greek epoch is pure humanities in content and methods” (Mager & Hein, 2019). This perspective situates mathematics alongside literature and philosophy as a discipline concerned with meaning, beauty, and truth.

### The Role of Abstraction
Mathematics often operates independently of empirical application. Pure mathematics—such as number theory or topology—can exist without any direct technological utility, much like poetry or abstract art. This detachment from immediate practicality aligns mathematics with the humanities, where value is often intrinsic rather than instrumental.

## Aesthetic and Cultural Dimensions

### The Beauty of Mathematical Thought
Mathematicians frequently describe their work in aesthetic terms, valuing elegance, symmetry, and simplicity. These qualities are akin to those appreciated in the arts. As Mager and Hein (2019) note, mathematics shares with the humanities “the beauty of truth emerging from itself”.

### Mathematics as Cultural Heritage
Mathematics reflects the cultures that produce it. From Babylonian astronomy to Islamic algebra and Chinese geometry, mathematical systems are embedded in specific historical and cultural contexts. This cultural embeddedness supports its classification as a humanities subject, as it contributes to our understanding of human intellectual history.

## Counterarguments: The Case for Mathematics in STEM

### Mathematics as the Language of Science
Proponents of the STEM classification argue that mathematics is indispensable to scientific inquiry. It provides the formal language for physics, chemistry, and engineering, enabling precise modeling and prediction (Li & Schoenfeld, 2019). Without mathematics, modern science would be impossible.

### Mathematics in Interdisciplinary STEM Education
Recent research emphasizes mathematics’ role in interdisciplinary STEM problem-solving, particularly in engineering and technology contexts (Goos et al., 2023). Mathematics is often positioned as the foundational discipline that underpins the others, making its inclusion in STEM seem natural.

## Rebuttals to Counterarguments

While mathematics undeniably supports scientific work, this functional role does not define its essence. Literature can inform political science, and philosophy can influence law, yet these disciplines remain within the humanities. The fact that mathematics is useful in STEM fields does not necessitate its classification within STEM. As Kristensen et al. (2024) caution, mathematics in STEM contexts is often reduced to a mere tool, overshadowing its broader intellectual and cultural significance.

## Implications of Reclassification

### Educational Impact
Reclassifying mathematics as a humanities discipline could shift pedagogical approaches, emphasizing reasoning, creativity, and historical context over rote computation. This might make mathematics more accessible and engaging to students who are alienated by its current STEM framing.

### Cultural Recognition
Such a reclassification would acknowledge mathematics as part of humanity’s shared intellectual heritage, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue between mathematicians, philosophers, artists, and historians.

## Conclusion
Mathematics is more than a utilitarian instrument of science and technology; it is a profound human achievement that embodies philosophical inquiry, aesthetic appreciation, and cultural expression. While its applications in STEM are undeniable, these do not capture its full nature. Recognizing mathematics as a humanities discipline would honor its historical roots and broaden our understanding of its role in human civilization.
