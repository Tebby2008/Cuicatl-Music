## The Cultural and Educational Significance of Skibidi Toilet: A Case for High School and Advanced Placement Study
### Abstract
The viral machinima web series Skibidi Toilet, created by Alexey Gerasimov and distributed via YouTube, has emerged as a global cultural phenomenon. While its absurdist humor and surreal visuals may appear frivolous, the series offers rich opportunities for interdisciplinary study in media literacy, cultural analysis, and creative thinking. This paper argues that Skibidi Toilet should be integrated into high school curricula—and potentially offered as an Advanced Placement (AP) course—due to its relevance in understanding internet culture, fostering critical thinking, and engaging students in contemporary media discourse.

### Introduction
In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital media, educators face the challenge of connecting with students whose cultural touchstones are increasingly shaped by online phenomena. Skibidi Toilet, a machinima series produced using Source Filmmaker, depicts a surreal conflict between anthropomorphic toilets with human heads and humanoid figures with electronic devices for heads. Since its debut in 2023, the series has amassed millions of views and inspired countless memes, remixes, and fan theories2. While some dismiss it as nonsensical entertainment, its cultural impact and pedagogical potential warrant serious academic consideration.

### Cultural Relevance and Global Appeal
The Skibidi Toilet phenomenon exemplifies the globalization of internet humor. By blending slapstick comedy, absurdist narrative, and meme culture, it resonates with audiences across linguistic and cultural boundaries. As Kroha’s analysis notes, the series “integrates various cultural references and internet memes” to create a shared, participatory experience for viewers worldwide2. This makes it an ideal case study for exploring how digital media fosters cross-cultural communication and collective identity formation.

### Cognitive and Creative Benefits
Research in media psychology suggests that exposure to unconventional narratives can enhance divergent thinking and problem-solving skills (Runco & Acar, 2012). Skibidi Toilet’s unpredictable plotlines and surreal imagery challenge viewers to make sense of illogical scenarios, thereby exercising cognitive flexibility. As the parental-control.net article observes, the series “encourages audiences… to think outside the box and appreciate diverse forms of artistic expression”. In a classroom setting, this could translate into exercises in creative writing, visual analysis, and speculative storytelling.

### Media Literacy and Critical Thinking
Incorporating Skibidi Toilet into high school curricula aligns with the growing emphasis on media literacy education. Students could analyze its production techniques, narrative structures, and audience reception, developing skills to critically evaluate digital content. As Livingstone (2004) argues, media literacy is essential for navigating the complexities of contemporary information ecosystems. By dissecting Skibidi Toilet, students learn to identify satire, parody, and intertextuality—tools that are increasingly vital in an era of misinformation.

### Sociological and Psychological Insights
The series also offers fertile ground for sociological inquiry. Its bizarre conflict between “toilet” and “camera” factions can be interpreted as an allegory for technological integration and human identity in the digital age. Psychologically, its humor provides a form of catharsis, offering relief from daily stress through absurdity—a phenomenon supported by Freud’s relief theory of humor (Freud, 1905/1960).

### The Case for AP Skibidi Toilet
An Advanced Placement course on Skibidi Toilet could integrate elements of media studies, cultural anthropology, psychology, and art. Students might:

1. Conduct semiotic analyses of episodes.<br>

2. Explore fan culture and participatory media.<br>

3. Compare Skibidi Toilet to historical absurdist movements such as Dadaism.<br>

4. Create original machinima projects inspired by the series.<br>

5. Such a course would not only engage students but also prepare them for college-level critical analysis of contemporary media.<br>

### Addressing Criticism
Critics may argue that Skibidi Toilet lacks the gravitas of traditional literary or artistic works. However, as Jenkins (2006) notes in Convergence Culture, popular media often serves as a gateway to deeper cultural engagement. By meeting students where they are, educators can leverage their existing interests to foster academic skills.

### Conclusion
Far from being mere internet ephemera, Skibidi Toilet encapsulates key aspects of 21st-century media culture. Its study can enhance creativity, critical thinking, and cultural literacy—skills essential for navigating an increasingly digital world. Integrating it into high school curricula, and even offering it as an AP course, would acknowledge the legitimacy of contemporary digital art forms and equip students with tools to critically engage with their media environment.
